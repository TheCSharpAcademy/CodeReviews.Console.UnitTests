# Unit Testing
By __Zube Pierre Basali__ for __TheCSharpAcademy__

## Introduction
This is a simple project to learn how basic unit testing works using .NET MSTest Library.

## Requirements
- In this project, you'll create unit tests for the Coding Tracker App, the second project in the course

- You'll need to create a CodingTracker.Tests project, parallel to your coding tracker and reference it in your csproj file

- You'll only test the validation methods, making sure the app correctly prevents the user from giving incorrect inputs

- You should use .NETs MSTest Library

- You should test both correct and incorrect inputs

## Structure
The project is made of two solutions, the first one (Coding Tracker) is an older project taken to test simple functions.<br>
The real project is CodingTracker.UnitTests.<br>
It consist of a simple unit tests to evaluate functions and their results to help track and understand errors, or verify function behaviors.

## Thougts and Remarks
This project was simple but very useful to help building better programs and develop them more efficiently.<br>
It's a great tool to test small functions or functions not depending on the UI and verify and correct their behaviors.
