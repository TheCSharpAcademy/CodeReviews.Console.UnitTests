# Unit Testing (using the Coding Tracker app)

The [Unit Testing](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/21/unit-testing) project requires that we revisit the [Coding Tracker](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/13/coding-tracker) app and add unit tests for the validation methods. This project is part of the curriculum from [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/).

## Requirements

- [x] In this project, you'll create unit tests for the Coding Tracker app, the second project in the course.
- [x] You'll need to create a CodingTracker.Tests project, parallel to your coding tracker and reference it in your .csproj file.
- [x] You'll only test the validation methods, making sure the app correctly prevents the user from giving incorrect inputs.
- [x] You should use .NET's MSTest Library.
- [x] You should test both correct and incorrect inputs.
