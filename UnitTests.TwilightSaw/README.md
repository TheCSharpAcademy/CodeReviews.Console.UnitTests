# UnitTests

## Given Requirements:

- [x] This is a project which contains the unit tests for the CodingTracker application.
- [x] Testing only the validation methods.
- [x] Using .NET MSTest Library.
- [x] Testing both incorrect and correct inputs.

## Features

- Unit tests for the CodingTracker application, created with .NET MSTest Library.

## Challenges and Learned Lessons

- First of all, the project itself was not written properly in terms of testability, so tests does not cover every method.
- As unit tests are vital for project maintaining and development, it should be foreseen in advance when you start to write the code, maybe considering the usage of TDD.
- Mocking the data from a user are not so easy(or even impossible) when it comes to methods which take user inputs and validates them in the same context.

## Areas to Improve

- Writing testable code.
- Mocking data in unit tests.
- Writing better unit tests.

## Resources Used

- C# Academy guidelines and roadmap.
- ChatGPT for new information as .NET MSTest Library, mocking data, creating unit tests, etc..
